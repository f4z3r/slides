# f4z3r's Slides

This repository is born out of the requests to share my slides from various talks I made at
conferences. I thus decided to start a repository that contains the slides for my future talks here.

I build most of my presentations with `presenterm` and `d2`. Since building these presentations is a
bit dependent on the terminal sizing I might use, the project will contain build outputs to ensure
that the presentations are easily navigable directly on GitHub.

Nonetheless, one can build or run the actual presentations using `devbox run present` in most cases.
Refer to the `devbox.json` file in the respective folder.
