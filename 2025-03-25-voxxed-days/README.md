Presentation for Voxxed Days ZÃ¼rich 2025.

This uses `presenterm`. DevBox provides the necessary tooling and shell scripts to build the
presentation (generate a PDF) or to directly present it in the terminal. Note that using Kitty as a
terminal provides the best results for rendering images and animated GIFs.
