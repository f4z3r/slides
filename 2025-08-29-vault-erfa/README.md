# Vault Introduction

Presentation for an introduction to Vault for a workshop based on:
https://github.com/f4z3r/vault-workshop

This uses `presenterm`. DevBox provides the necessary tooling and shell scripts to directly present
it in the terminal. Note that using Kitty as a terminal provides the best results for rendering
images and animated GIFs.
